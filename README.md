# Evohomeclient

C++ client for the Honeywell Evohome Web API

## Description

This project takes a lot of its ideas from watchforstock's Python based evohomeclient.

Reason for redeveloping this in C++ is that I run an implementation on a rather tiny machine and Python is quite heavy on resources. And slow. Of course, if you like the lib you can use it for any other project.

## Demo

There are several (simple) demos included in this project that show how the library can be used. Feel free to use whatever you like from these sources to build your own project using this library. Run ` make demo ` to build and check out these demos. One demo that people appear to like in particular is the schedule backup and restore utility.

## Implementation

Looking for the Evohome client for Domoticz? I have moved that into it's own project [domoticz-evohomeclient](https://github.com/gordonb3/domoticz-evohomeclient). As the [Version 1 client](https://github.com/gordonb3/evohomeclient/releases/tag/v1.0) has since been integrated into Domoticz the domoticz-evohomeclient project has become obsolete en been archived for reference. For those interested I do however also have an Evohome companion app for Domoticz that allows sending extended commands like overriding a zone temperature setting for a duration of time to Evohome through Domoticz. [dzEvo can be found here](https://github.com/gordonb3/dzEvo).
